# Unhandled Database Connection Error in Node.js Express Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: unhandled exceptions during database interactions. The application crashes when the database connection fails, disrupting service.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution that handles database errors gracefully.
